# The Cook Book

This project represents a website for cooking lovers and uses modern tech to represent the information in the best way possible. 

This Website provides you with the a broad options of recipes that you would like to try out
and also makes it possible to add your favorite recipes yourself.

## User experience

This website focuses on the users that have a special passion for cooking and surely the coocking fanatics and lovers. Once the website is loaded you will be directed
to the main page that it's called **All Recipes**

As a User I would like to have a simple UX that is self explantory and at the same time efficient enough to do what I'm expecting from it,
Like fetching and manipulating date easily. Like clicking the **Add recipe** button and you know what comes next and it's easy to fill out. That is my goal as a user.

Here come the **Mockups** that I planned my project with.

## Features

In this section we will be talking about the features that I implemented in this project and features that could be implemented as well:

#### Existing Features:

* **Adding a Recipe:** At this point when the user click the button "Add Recipe" She/He will be redirected to a page with a submission form that provides several fields to add the needed data in order to get your recipe displayed. 
* **Editing a Recipe:** Once you have added a recipe and realize that you would like to change something in it, I added an "Edit" button on the bottom of each recipe to make it possible to do so. 
* **Deleting a Recipe:** In case the user would like to delete a recipe that She/He added, All is needed to press on the "Del" button next to the edit button and than they will be facing a model popup asking to confirm the deletion. 

All those feature above are presented in a easy manner to make it simple for the user to take advantage of them. 

#### Left to be implemented Features:

* Adding a upload file section to the **Add Recipe** instead of asking for a URL. This can be achieved by using AWS S3 and connect it to MongoDB. 
* Making the Categories page linked to the recipe so once you choose a specific category, you will be redirected to those specific recipes of that specific category.
