# The Cook Book

This project represents a website for cooking lovers and uses modern tech to represent the information in the best way possible. 

This Website provides you with the a broad options of recipes that you would like to try out
and also makes it possible to add your favorite recipes yourself.

## User experience

This website focuses on the users that have a special passion for cooking and surely the coocking fanatics and lovers. Once the website is loaded you will be directed
to the main page that it's called **All Recipes**

As a User I would like to have a simple UX that is self explantory and at the same time efficient enough to do what I'm expecting from it,
Like fetching and manipulating date easily. Like clicking the **Add recipe** button and you know what comes next and it's easy to fill out. That is my goal as a user.
